<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>
  I'm Jeremy, a sophomore studying computer science at Harvard University. I'm
  interested in product and systems engineering.
</p>

<p>
  Next summer, I'll be interning as a software engineer at Facebook. This past
  summer, I interned at Lime, building the backend to enable full-scale
  third-party integrations with public transit providers. Before that, I
  interned at Cisco for a year, working on data processing and internal tooling.
</p>

<p>
  On campus, I help write the scoring and matching algorithms for Datamatch,
  a matchmaking service started at Harvard that has since expanded to
  over 34 schools.
</p>

<h2>What Else?</h2>
<p>
  Some of my friends think I'm a giant nerd. That's sort of accurate. It turns
  out I really like programming and can sometimes lose myself in working on
  <a href="/projects">side projects</a> either on my own or with friends.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, I really enjoy playing tennis, <a href="/reading">reading</a>,
  and playing with my dogs. On rare occasions, I may even <em>try</em> to dance.
  And in non-quarantine times, you can find me exploring whatever city or place
  I'm in with my blue backpack and white Stan Smiths!

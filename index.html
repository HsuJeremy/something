<h3>üëãüèª Hi, I'm Jeremy!</h3>
<p>
  I'm a junior studying computer science at Harvard University and am
  interested in distributed systems, databases, and systems for machine learning.
</p>

<p>
  I recently interned at <a href="https://about.facebook.com/meta">Meta</a> on
  the Facebook Avatars team, working on the backend for sticker categories in
  the Facebook news feed. I've also previously interned at
  <a href="https://www.li.me">Lime</a> for a summer, working on deep
  integrations with third-party transit providers; and at
  <a href="https://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a> for a year, working on internal
  tooling and data pipelines for the Webex media engine.
</p>

<p>
  On campus, I'm a research assistant for Dr. Stratos Idreos in the
  <a href="http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu/">Data Systems Lab</a>, working on
  systems for deep learning, and a research assistant for Dr. Eddie Kohler,
  working on highly-parallel multicore databases. I also help write the scoring
  and matching algorithms for <a href="https://datamatch.me/">Datamatch</a>, a
  matchmaking service started at Harvard that has since expanded to over 40
  schools.
</p>

<p>
  Some of my friends think I'm a giant nerd. That's partially accurate. At the
  same time, I really enjoy playing tennis, <a href="/reading">reading</a>, and
  playing with my dogs. On rare occasions,I may even <em>try</em> to dance. And
  outside of the CS bubble, you can find me exploring whatever city or place I'm
  in with my blue backpack and white Stan Smiths!

<h3>👋🏻 Hi, I'm Jeremy!</h3>

<p>
  I'm a recent graduate from Harvard University, where I studied Computer Science
  with a focus on computer systems. Specifically, I found myself interested in
  distributed systems, operating systems, databases, and ML infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
  During college, I completed summer internships at <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>
  (infrastructure), <a href="https://about.facebook.com/meta">Meta</a> (full-stack),
  and <a href="https://www.li.me">Lime</a> (full-stack). I also took a gap year between
  my first and second years to intern at <a href="https://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a>
  (metrics and internal tooling). 
</p>

<p>
  On campus, I got fairly involved in systems research (serverless
  computing, self-designing databases, and systems for ML), serving on the course
  staff for <a href="https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2023/#gsc.tab=0">CS 61</a>, 
  and designing and writing algorithms for <a href="https://datamatch.me">Datamatch</a>.
</p>

  publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/HsuJeremy">GitHub</a>. I can

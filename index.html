<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>
  I'm Jeremy, a sophomore at Harvard University studying Computer Science
  interested in product and systems engineering. I'm currently
  <strong>seeking a software engineering internship for summer 2022</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  I took a gap year after completing my freshman year in May 2020 to intern as a
  software engineer at Cisco. This summer, I interned as a software engineer at
  Lime.
</p>

<p>
  On campus, I help write the scoring and matching algorithms for Datamatch,
  a matchmaking service started at Harvard that has since expanded to
  over 34 schools.
</p>

<h2>What Else?</h2>
<p>
  Some of my friends think I'm a giant nerd. That's sort of accurate. It turns
  out I really like programming and can sometimes lose myself in working on
  <a href="/projects">side projects</a> either on my own or with friends.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, I really enjoy playing tennis, <a href="/reading">reading</a>,
  and playing with my dogs. On rare occasions, I may even <em>try</em> to dance.
  And in non-quarantine times, you can find me exploring whatever city or place
  I'm in with my blue backpack and white Stan Smiths!
</p>

<h2>Hi, I'm Jeremy!</h2>
<p>
  I'm a junior studying computer science at Harvard University and am broadly
  interested in systems, backend development, and machine learning. <strong>I'm
  currently looking for a software engineering internship for summer 2023.
  </strong>
</p>

<p>
  I recently interned at <a href="https://about.facebook.com/meta">Meta</a> on
  the Facebook Avatars team, working on the backend for sticker categories in
  the Facebook news feed. I've also previously interned at
  <a href="https://www.li.me">Lime</a> for a summer, working on deep
  integrations with third-party transit providers; and at
  <a href="https://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a> for a year, working on internal
  tooling and data pipelines for the Webex media engine.
</p>

<p>
  On campus, I'm a research assistant for Dr. Stratos Idreos in the
  <a href="http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu/">Data Systems Lab</a>, working on
  cascading classifier architectures. I also help write the scoring and
  matching algorithms for <a href="https://datamatch.me/">Datamatch</a>, a
  matchmaking service started at Harvard that has since expanded to over 40
  schools.
</p>

<h2>What Else?</h2>
<p>
  Some of my friends think I'm a giant nerd. That's partially accurate. I really
  like programming and building apps, and can sometimes lose myself in working
  on <a href="/projects">side projects</a> either on my own or with friends (I
  also tend to pull far more all-nighters than I should fixing page faults).
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, I really enjoy playing tennis,
  <a href="/reading">reading</a>, and playing with my dogs. On rare occasions,
  I may even <em>try</em> to dance. And outside of the CS bubble, you can find
  me exploring whatever city or place I'm in with my blue backpack and white
  Stan Smiths!
</p>

<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>
  I'm Jeremy. I'm a sophomore studying computer science at Harvard University
  and am interested in product and systems engineering.
</p>

<p>
  This summer, I'll be interning as a software engineer at Facebook. I interned
  at Lime last summer, building the backend to enable full-scale
  third-party integrations with public transit providers. I interned at Cisco
  for a year before that, working on data processing and internal tooling.
</p>

<p>
  On campus, I help write the scoring and matching algorithms for Datamatch,
  a matchmaking service started at Harvard that has since expanded to
  over 34 schools. I also tend to pull more all-nighters than I should fixing
  segmentation faults.
</p>

<h2>What Else?</h2>
<p>
  Some of my friends think I'm a giant nerd. That's sort of accurate. I really
  like programming and building apps, and can sometimes lose myself in working on
  <a href="/projects">side projects</a> either on my own or with friends.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, I really enjoy playing tennis, <a href="/reading">reading</a>,
  and playing with my dogs. On rare occasions, I may even <em>try</em> to dance.
  And in non-quarantine times, you can find me exploring whatever city or place
  I'm in with my blue backpack and white Stan Smiths!
</p>

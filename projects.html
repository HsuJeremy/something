		Spotify Curator is a full-stack web application leveraging machine learning
		to help users discover new songs they love. Spotify Curator calls the
		Spotify API to securely authenticate users and store their liked songs'
		attributes as training data. It then performs k-means clustering to
		determine the probability that the user will like any new song or playlist.
		Model training and predictions are stored in a distributed task queue and
		picked up asynchronously by Celery workers. Redis serves as both a message
		broker and result store for the queue.

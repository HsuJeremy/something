<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>
	I'm Jeremy, a rising sophomore at Harvard University studying Computer Science.
	Currently, I’m interested in distributed systems, machine learning, operating
	systems, and full-stack development.
</p>

<p>
	For the past year, I've been working as a software engineer at Cisco while on
	a gap year from Harvard. I'll be interning at Lime this summer and will
	return to campus in the fall.
</p>

<p>
	On campus, I conduct research related to computer networking and distributed
	systems. I’m also help write the scoring and matching algorithms for Datamatch,
	a matchmaking service originally started at Harvard that has now expanded to
	over 34 schools.
</p>

<h2>What Else?</h2>
<p>
	Some of my friends think I'm a giant nerd. That's sort of accurate. It turns
	out I really like programming and can sometimes lose myself in working on
	<a href="/projects">side projects</a> either on my own or with friends.
</p>
<p>
	At the same time, I really enjoy playing tennis, <a href="/reading">reading</a>,
	and playing with my dogs. On rare occasions, I may even <em>try</em> to dance.
	And in non-quarantine times, you can find me exploring whatever city or place
	I'm in with my blue backpack and white Stan Smiths!
</p>
